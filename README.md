Use flyd in Vue!

This is kind of silly, but could offer you an easy way to try out streams if you're coming from a vue background.  Or, possibly, you have a few components with very hairy interactions and you want to leverage the power of streams to manage that complexity.  Or you just like bolting things together without regard for others' sanity!
